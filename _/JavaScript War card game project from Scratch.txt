Card war is a simple game with straight forward rules and it makes a great digital project.  The rules require a dealing of cards to each player, then taking the top card and seeing which player has the highest card.  The high card wins the pot and the won cards then go to the bottom of the players stack.  The first player to run out of cards loses!
